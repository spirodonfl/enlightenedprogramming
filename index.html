                <li>New articles</li>
                <li>New videos</li>

            </ul>
            <p>It is time consuming to create these articles. It is even *more* time consuming to go over scientific and academic studies to gather the information I have so far. In the future, I may have to charge a nominal fee to see some of the bigger content. However, what I'd like to do is give people who join the notification list exclusive, free or discounted access. I also want to setup a special newsletter where I present summaries of the data I have, weekly. Please consider joining the mailing list.</p>

        <h2>Preface</h2>
        <p>This is somewhat of a joke but the principles are real. I am a software engineer and I have been working in the field for over 10 years. I have seen the good, the bad, and the ugly of programming. I have seen the beauty of well-crafted code and the horror of spaghetti code. I have seen the power of logic and the chaos of bugs. Through it all, I have come to appreciate the art and science of programming, and the profound impact it has on our world.</p>
        <p>I am also a streamer and I have been streaming on Twitch for a while now. I have built a community of coders who share my passion for programming and technology. Together, we explore new languages, work on projects, and learn from each other. It is a place of collaboration, creativity, and camaraderie.</p>
        <p>I was also in a cult, Jehovah's Witnesses, for 30 years. I have seen the good, the bad, and the ugly of religion. I have seen the beauty of faith and the horror of fanaticism. I have seen the power of belief and the chaos of dogma. Through it all, I have come to appreciate the wisdom and folly of religion, and the profound impact it has on our world, positively and negatively.</p>
        <p>That religion left me homeless, poor, sleeping in my car, hungry many nights and more. All before I was 25 years old. Programming got me out of that spiral. I worked for free for many years so I could get the experience I needed to land my first paying job.</p>
        <p>I am here, as a nobody, to tell you that you can do it too. You can learn to code and you can get a job in tech. You can change your life and the lives of those around you. You can do it. I believe in you.</p>
        <p>I thought it would be fun to combine my love of programming with my love of spirituality. The result is this tongue-in-cheek manifesto that explores the parallels between programming and religion. It is meant to be a light-hearted take on a serious subject, and I hope you enjoy it.</p>
        <p>I also want to encourage people to open their eyes to the "false prophets" of programming. There are many people out there who claim to be experts, but in reality, they are just charlatans who are more interested in self-promotion than in helping others. They are the ones who spread misinformation, create toxic environments, and exploit the vulnerable. They are the ones who give programming a bad name. .These people believe they are the arbiters of truth for the programming community, as if some programming god speaks directly to them, but they offer no real value to the community. To you.</p>

The content will be in the form of video, audio and written posts that will guide you through the world of programming the way in which I think will benefit *YOU* the most.</p>
