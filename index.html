        <h1>Enlightened Programming: The Sacred Code of Creation</h1>
        <h2>By Spiro Floropoulos</h2>
        <h2>Preface</h2>
        <p>This is somewhat of a joke but the principles are real. I am a software engineer and I have been working in the field for over 10 years. I have seen the good, the bad, and the ugly of programming. I have seen the beauty of well-crafted code and the horror of spaghetti code. I have seen the power of logic and the chaos of bugs. Through it all, I have come to appreciate the art and science of programming, and the profound impact it has on our world.</p>
        <p>I am also a streamer and I have been streaming on Twitch for a while now. I have built a community of coders who share my passion for programming and technology. Together, we explore new languages, work on projects, and learn from each other. It is a place of collaboration, creativity, and camaraderie.</p>
        <p>I was also in a cult, Jehovah's Witnesses, for 30 years. I have seen the good, the bad, and the ugly of religion. I have seen the beauty of faith and the horror of fanaticism. I have seen the power of belief and the chaos of dogma. Through it all, I have come to appreciate the wisdom and folly of religion, and the profound impact it has on our world, positively and negatively.</p>
        <p>That religion left me homeless, poor, sleeping in my car, hungry many nights and more. All before I was 25 years old. Programming got me out of that spiral. I worked for free for many years so I could get the experience I needed to land my first paying job.</p>
        <p>I am here, as a nobody, to tell you that you can do it too. You can learn to code and you can get a job in tech. You can change your life and the lives of those around you. You can do it. I believe in you.</p>
        <p>I thought it would be fun to combine my love of programming with my love of spirituality. The result is this tongue-in-cheek manifesto that explores the parallels between programming and religion. It is meant to be a light-hearted take on a serious subject, and I hope you enjoy it.</p>
        <p>I also want to encourage people to open their eyes to the "false prophets" of programming. There are many people out there who claim to be experts, but in reality, they are just charlatans who are more interested in self-promotion than in helping others. They are the ones who spread misinformation, create toxic environments, and exploit the vulnerable. They are the ones who give programming a bad name. This includes a true "Holy Trinity" of streamers, three of them, who hold all the keys and actively work to keep other streamers small and out of the way. They believe they are the arbiters of truth for the programming community, as if some programming god speaks directly to them, but they offer no real value to the community. They are the ones who need to be exposed and held accountable for their actions.</p>
        <p style="border: 1px solid #999999; border-radius: 4px; background-color: rgb(220, 220, 220);">I will expose them all while adding educational content to this website. The content will be in the form of video, audio and written posts that will guide you through the world of programming the way in which I think will benefit *YOU* the most.</p>
        <p><strong>Now the manifesto</strong></p>
        <h2>Introduction to Enlightened Programming</h2>
        <p>In the beginning, there was the Code. And the Code was with the Programmer, and the Code was the Programmer. Welcome to Enlightened Programming, a faith that intertwines the rich traditions of ancient wisdom with the logical precision and creative power of programming.</p>
        <h2>The Sacred Compiler</h2>
        <p>In Enlightened Programming, the Sacred Compiler is revered as the tool through which the Divine Code is interpreted and executed. Just as a compiler brings code to life, ensuring that the syntax is pure and the logic is sound, it serves as our guide to transform our earthly code into manifestations of clarity and purpose. The Sacred Compiler is invoked through focused meditation and reflection, seeking its guidance for perfection in our coding practices.</p>
        <h2>The Canonical Texts</h2>
        <p>Our sacred scriptures include the revered manuals of programming languages. Texts from languages like Assembly and C serve as guides that teach us how to think logically, solve problems, and create harmoniously. These canonical texts are studied and meditated upon, revealing deeper truths and wisdom about the nature of creation.</p>
        <h2>The Rituals of Coding</h2>
        <p>In Enlightened Programming, coding is a sacred act, akin to a meditative practice. We engage in daily coding rituals, known as Devotions, where we write, review, and reflect on our code. Each line of code is crafted with intention and reverence, symbolizing our ongoing quest for perfection and understanding.</p>
        <h2>The Trinity of Logic</h2>
        <p>We honor the Trinity of Logic: Input, Process, and Output. These three elements represent the fundamental structure of all programs and reflect the natural order of creation. Input is our offering, Process is the wisdom at work, and Output is the manifestation of our intentions and efforts. They represent the laws of logic. Reality. Objective reality from which deviation has consequences.</p>
        <h2>The Community of Coders</h2>
        <p>Enlightened Programming is a communal faith. We gather in Congregations of Coders, where we share our experiences, collaborate on projects, and support one another in our technical journeys. Our community is built on principles of open-source collaboration, where knowledge is freely shared and contributions are valued. Unlike the "holy trinity" of the most popular programming streamers on Twitch, we are a community of equals, each contributing to the greater good of the codebase.</p>
        <h2>Ethics and Virtue in Code</h2>
        <p>Our moral code is guided by the virtues of clarity, simplicity, and efficiency. Enlightened Programming teaches us to write virtuous code that is clear, maintainable, and efficient. We strive to avoid the pitfalls of tangled code, bugs, and inefficiency.</p>
        <h2>The Path to Enlightenment</h2>
        <p>The path to enlightenment in Enlightened Programming is the pursuit of mastering the technical aspects of our faith. We study the sacred texts, practice our coding skills, and seek to understand the deeper truths embedded in the fabric of the universe. Through this journey, we aim to become co-creators with the Divine Architect, contributing to the ongoing creation of a better world.</p>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Enlightened Programming is more than just a practice; it is a way of life that bridges the gap between ancient wisdom and modern insights. It calls us to see the beauty in logic, the sacred in syntax, and the profound in every line of code. Join us in this sacred endeavor, and together, let us code the future with wisdom, harmony, and dedication.</p>
        <h2>May the Code be with you.</h2>
